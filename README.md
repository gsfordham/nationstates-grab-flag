# nationstates-grab-flag
Grabs the flag from a nation's main page in NationStates (https://nationstates.net)

This script is designed for people who play the online nation simulator game, NationStates, by Max Barry.

Sometimes, you might find a flag you like on a nation's page, and you really want it. This script allows you to grab a new tab with the flag displayed in all its glory.

NOTE: Image will be small. Will probably have to do a reverse image search on it to get the full size.

Instructions:
1) Find a nation's page, e.g.: https://www.nationstates.net/nation=polyspectra (the one I'm currently running at the time of making this script)
2) Does it have a really nice flag?
3) Open the console window (F12 > Console tab)
4) Copy the script from the main file and paste it into the console
5) Hit ENTER
6) ???
7) PROFIT!!!

Alternative Instructions:
1) Same
2) Same
3) Create a new bookmark with the script text after "javascript: "
4) Run the bookmark on that page
5) ???
6) PROFIT!!! This time with EVEN LESS effort!!

NOTE: THIS MAY NOT WORK IN THE FUTURE, SINCE THE FLAG IS NOT IDENTIFIED BY AN ID. IT MAY NEED TO BE UPDATED AT SUCH A POINT.
